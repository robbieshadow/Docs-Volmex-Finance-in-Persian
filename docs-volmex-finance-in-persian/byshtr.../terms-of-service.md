6.1 The Site and the Services are governed by the Business Source License 1.1, a copy of which (as it applies to the Site and the Services) can be found at https://github.com/volmexfinance/volmex-core/blob/master/LICENSE (add the date these Terms were last updated) and any other applicable licensing terms for the Site and the Services in these Terms (collectively, the “Volmex License”). You acknowledge that the Site or the Services may use, incorporate or link to certain open-source components and that your use of the Site or Services is subject to, and you will comply with any, applicable open-source licenses that govern any such open-source components (collectively, “Open-Source Licenses”).

6.2 Excluding the open-source software described in Section 6.1 or third-party software that the Site or the Services incorporates, as between you and Volmex, Volmex owns the Site and the Services, including all technology, content, and other materials used, displayed, or provided on the Site or in connection with the Services (including all intellectual property rights subsisting therein), and hereby grants you a limited, revocable, transferable, license to access and use those portions of the Site and the Services that are proprietary to Volmex.

6.3 Any of Volmex’s product or service names, logos, and other marks used on the Site or as a part of the Services, including Volmex’s name and logo are trademarks owned by Volmex, its affiliates, or its applicable licensors.

You may not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with the Services.

6.4 The Services are non-custodial. When you deposit digital assets into an account in any smart contract initially developed by Volmex, you retain control over those digital assets at all times. The private key associated with the Ethereum address from which you transfer digital assets and/or the private key associated with the Optimism or Polygon account or any other storage scalability service account is the only private key that can control the digital assets you transfer into these smart contracts. In some cases, you may withdraw digital assets from any smart contract initially developed by Volmex only to the Ethereum address from which you deposited the digital assets.

7.1 The Services provide, or third parties may provide, links to other World Wide Web or accessible sites, applications, or resources. You acknowledge and agree that Volmex is not responsible for the availability of such external sites, applications or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that Volmex shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such site or resource.

8\. Modification, Suspension, and Termination

8.1 We may, at our sole discretion, from time to time and with or without prior notice to you, modify, suspend or disable (temporarily or permanently) the Services, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, to only allow outstanding Volatility Tokens to be closed.

8.2 You acknowledge and agree that Volmex will have no obligation to provide you with any support or maintenance in connection with the Website or App.

8.3 Upon termination of your access, your right to use the Services will immediately cease. We will not be liable for any losses suffered by you resulting from any modification to any Services or from any modification, suspension, or termination, for any reason, of your access to all or any portion of the Site or the Services or the Volatility Tokens.

8.4 Subject to this Section, these Terms will remain in full force and effect while you use or access the Site or Services. We may suspend or terminate your rights to use or access the Site or Services at any time for any reason at our sole discretion, including for any use of the Site or Services in violation of these Terms. Upon termination of your rights under these Terms, your right to access and use the Site and Services will terminate immediately. The following sections of these Terms will survive any termination of your access to the Site or the Services, regardless of the reasons for its expiration or termination, in addition to any other provision which by law or by its nature should survive: Sections 6 through 15.

9.1 By utilizing the Services or interacting with the Site in any way, you represent and warrant that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems and blockchain-based networks; digital assets, including the usage and intricacies of native digital assets, like ether (ETH); smart contract-based tokens, such as those that follow the Ethereum Token Standard; and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. Volmex does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed. In general, the software underlying blockchain networks, including the Ethereum blockchain, is open source, such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it.

9.2 By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree (a) that Volmex is not responsible for the operation of the software and networks underlying the Services, (b) that there exists no guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of that software and networks, and (c) that the underlying networks are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as “forks,” which may materially affect the Services.

9.3 Blockchain networks use public/private key cryptography. You alone are responsible for securing your private key(s). We do not have access to your private key(s). Losing control of your private key(s) will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain or other blockchain-based network. Neither Volmex nor any other person or entity will be able to retrieve or protect your digital assets. If your private key(s) are lost, then you will not be able to transfer your digital assets to any other blockchain address or wallet. If this occurs, then you will not be able to realize any value or utility from the digital assets that you may hold.

9.4 The Services and your digital assets could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Volmex to continue to make available any portion(s) of the Site or Services which rely on any Volmex proprietary software and, thus, could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Services.

9.5 You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code cracking or other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to digital assets and the Services, and could result in the theft or loss of your digital assets. To the extent possible, we intend to update the smart contracts related to the Services to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks presented from technological advancements, but that intention does not guarantee or otherwise ensure full security of the Services.

9.6 You understand that the Ethereum blockchain remains under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Services in addition to uncertainty relating to digital assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the Ethereum blockchain is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain, which may result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Services.

9.7 You acknowledge that the Services are subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Services or Site. This warning and others Volmex provides in these Terms in no way evidence or represent an on-going duty to alert you to all of the potential risks of utilizing the Services or accessing the Site.

To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation, information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the Site or as part of the Services are your sole responsibility. No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the Site or otherwise when using the Services. Prices and pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on platforms providing similar services.

9.9 Any use or interaction with the Services requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science to appreciate the inherent risks, including those listed above. You represent and warrant that you possess relevant knowledge and skills. Any reference to a type of digital asset on the Site or otherwise during the use of the Services does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the digital asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of digital asset.

9.10 Use of the Services, in particular for trading digital assets, and issuing or acquiring Volatility Tokens, may carry financial risk. digital assets, especially in connection with Volatility Tokens, are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection with the Services are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site and the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading digital assets, especially issuing or acquiring Volatility Tokens, can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying digital assets, including Volatility Tokens. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with the Services or any digital asset. You accept all consequences of using the Services, including the risk that you may lose access to your digital assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with, your use of the Services for performing digital asset transactions, including issuing or acquiring Volatility Tokens.

9.11 We must comply with Applicable Law, which may require us to, upon request by government agencies, take certain actions or provide information, which may not be in your best interests.

9.12 You understand that the storage scalability services provided by Optimism, Polygon, or other storage scalability service, and our Services remain under development, which creates technological, trading, and other risks when using the Services. These risks include, among others, delays in trades, withdrawals, and deposits resulting from the servers of Volmex Optimism, Polygon or other storage scalability services being offline; an incorrect display of information on the Site in the case of server errors; or transactions using the Services being rolled back in the case of server errors. You acknowledge that these risks may have a material impact on your transactions using the Services, which may result in, among other things, failing to fulfill transactions at your desired price or at all.

9.13 You hereby acknowledge and agree that Volmex will have no responsibility or liability for, the risks set forth in this Section 9. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against Volmex, its affiliates, and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives, suppliers, and contractors related to any of the risks set forth in this Section 9.

10.1 You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Volmex, its affiliates, and its and its affiliates’ respective stockholders, members, directors, officers, managers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, and contractors (collectively, “Indemnified Parties”) from any claim, demand, lawsuit, action, proceeding, investigation, liability, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to (a) your use of, or conduct in connection with, the Site or the Services (including, without limitation, the Optimism or Polygon services); (b) digital assets associated with your Ethereum address; (c) any feedback or user content you provide to Volmex, if any, concerning the Site or the Services; (d) your violation of these Terms; or (e) your infringement or misappropriation of the rights of any other person or entity. If you are obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party, Volmex (or, at its discretion, the applicable Indemnified Party) will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether Volmex wishes to settle, and if so, on what terms, and you agree to corporate with Volmex in the defense.

13\. Dispute Resolution & Arbitration

13.1 Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Volmex and limits how you can seek relief from Volmex. Also, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

13.2 You and Volmex agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services is personal to you and Volmex and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding.

13.3 Except for small claims disputes in which you or Volmex seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Volmex seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Volmex waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Volmex or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact Volmex and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to Volmex by email at [\[email protected\]](<../../.gitbook/assets/email protection>) The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Volmex cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California, under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

13.4 You and Volmex agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 13 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

13.5 The arbitrator, Volmex, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared, and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

13.6 You and Volmex agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and all other JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Volmex, Volmex will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Volmex agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Delaware and the United States sitting in Dover, DE have exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of an arbitration award.

13.7 Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Volmex will not have the right to assert the claim.

13.8 If any portion of this Section 13 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 13 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis under this Section 13; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 13 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, then that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 13 will be enforceable.

14.1 The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any dispute related to these Terms, the Site or the Services, will be governed by and construed and enforced under the laws of the State of California, as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. For any other proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in any such courts.

15.3 Any right or remedy of Volmex set forth in these Terms is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy whether described in these Terms, under Applicable Law, at law, or in equity. The failure or delay of Volmex in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms shall not operate as a waiver thereof.

15.4 The invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.

15.5 We will have no responsibility or liability for any failure or delay in performance of the Site or any of the Services, or any loss or damage that you may incur, due to any circumstance or event beyond our control, including without limitation any flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction.

15.6 You may not assign or transfer any right to use the Site or the Services, or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms, without our express prior written consent, including by operation of law or in connection with any change of control.

15.7 Headings of sections are for convenience only and shall not be used to limit or construe such sections.

15.8 These Terms contain the entire agreement between you and Volmex, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the Site and the Services.

15.9 In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with us, these Terms will control unless the other agreement specifically identifies these Terms and declares that the other agreement supersedes these Terms.
